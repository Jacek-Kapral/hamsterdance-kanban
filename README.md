# hamsterdance-kanban
Repository of Hamsterdance team for course in IT Projects Management


A project started on 25 of February 2023, optimistically targeted on getting at least grade of 3
in IT Projects Management course on WSB. 
Excercise in applying SCRUM / Agile methodology to a small IT project that relies on using
Django and Vue.js frameworks to create a simple application to manage projects workflow 
using Kanban Table in form of chalkboard with notes similar to post-it.

Team consisting of students from ARIT1 group, some of them designated to backend, some of them
to frontend, and two guys in roles of Product Owner and Scrum Master.

We're more or less clueless, so nobody should try and copy our work, but feel free to use the code,
if You're reckless enough.

Kind regards, 
SCRUM MASTER
Jacek
